## Introduction

The Portfolio Chatbot is an chatbot designed to serve as a personal portfolio, allowing users to interact with the chatbot as though they are texting on a chat platform like WhatsApp. Users can ask questions about Samyak's skills, experience, and projects and navigate through different sections of the portfolio via chat.

This project is built with a focus on providing an engaging and intuitive user experience. Visitors can interact with the chatbot to access specific portfolio categories such as `Skills`, `Projects`, `Experience`, and more.

## Features

- Interactive Chat Interface: Mimics a WhatsApp-like chat interface for easy interaction.
- Portfolio Queries: Users can ask questions and retrieve information about Samyak's skills, projects, experience, and more.
- Command-based Options: Users can type `more` to display further categories such as:

  - Projects
  - Education
  - Experience
  - Contact Information
